        <h3>The Start</h3>
        <p>
            This is the start. I have made my first print screen of this brand new page and this will be the starting point of my learning journey. With each article it should evolve and with each article I should learn something new.
        </p>
          <img src="/Webpage1.png" alt="First PrintScreen" class="img-thumbnail">
        <p>
            Don't get me wrong I have no idea how to put my own webpage online and I have used some help with that. However, everything inside that page is mine. 
            This project started with the sole purpose of practicing skills that I am trying to learn, some HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and so on. For quite some time I have been in the tutorial loop consuming one video after another. I was trying to complete all the exercises. It surprised me that I did not remember much as I simply followed the guide. I actually did not concentrate on creating things from scratch myself. This webpage is meant to be that ultimate practice place for me.

            I have decided that I will go with those parts and elements that I notice first. So, the first thing that is messing with the whole layout is image. Let's see what I can do here.
